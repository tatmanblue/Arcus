## History
This project is a possible reincaration or version two of [XVault](https://github.com/tatmanblue/xvault).  I never got very far with XVault and not sure why I stopped working on it.  After reading an 
intriging real life story, recently, I started thinking about this project again.  XVault was an idea created 20 yrs ago around the idea of keeping data
safe from "hackers".  Today, this idea is more relevant.

## Status
