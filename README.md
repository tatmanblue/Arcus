## History
This project is a reincaration or version two of [XVault](https://github.com/tatmanblue/xvault).  I never got very far with XVault and not sure why I stopped working on it.  After reading an 
intriging real life story, recently, I started thinking about this project again.


## Status
Ideation -- limited updates at this time -- this project is created to explore the idea.
