# Arcus
Applications and services to securely store files, accessed remotely and locally.  



## Versions, ideas, plans
1. [Version 1](docs/V1_Plan.md) serves as a POC.  Calling this ___DONE___
2. [Version 2](docs/V2_Plan.md) Whats next?      
3. [Architecture](docs/arch.md) provides design notes, albeit rather vague atm  

## Installing and using 
There is nearly no documentation on this topic, yet.  Feel free to reach out to me or create a github issue and I will work with you.  There is a start of a [./doc](https://github.com/tatmanblue/Arcus/blob/main/docs/INSTALL_USE.md) but it is pretty terse at the moment.

## Issue tracking

All issues are tracked in YouTrack.   Will consider shifting to github issues, if there are public contributions.

## History
This project is a possible reincaration or version two of [XVault](https://github.com/tatmanblue/xvault).  I never got very far with XVault and not sure why I stopped working on it.  After reading an 
intriging real life story, recently, I started thinking about this project again.  XVault was an idea created 20 yrs ago around the idea of keeping data
safe from "hackers".  Today, this idea is more relevant.
